# Whisper Model Configuration Guide

## Current Production Setup

**Default Model**: `ggml-tiny.bin` (Fast processing, good quality)

## Available Models

| Model | File Size | Memory Usage | Processing Speed | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------------|---------|----------|
| `ggml-tiny` | 77MB | ~400MB RAM | **5-10x faster** | Good | Quick transcripts, real-time use |
| `ggml-base` | 147MB | ~600MB RAM | **3-5x faster** | Better | Balanced speed/quality |
| `ggml-small` | 190MB | ~800MB RAM | 1x (baseline) | Good | Original choice |
| `ggml-medium` | 769MB | ~2GB RAM | 0.5x slower | Better | High accuracy needs |
| `ggml-large` | 1550MB | ~4GB RAM | 0.3x slower | Best | Production quality |

## Performance Examples

### Typical Processing Times
- **5-minute video** with tiny model: ~30-60 seconds
- **30-minute video** with tiny model: ~3-6 minutes  
- **2-hour video** with tiny model: ~12-24 minutes

### Quality Comparison
- **tiny**: Excellent for English, good for accents, fast processing
- **base**: Better accuracy, handles multiple speakers well
- **small**: Good balance, original choice before optimization
- **medium/large**: Best accuracy, but much slower

## Switching Models

### For Development/Testing (docker-compose.local.yml)
```yaml
environment:
  - WHISPER_MODEL=ggml-tiny.bin  # Current default
```

### For Production (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
environment:
  - WHISPER_MODEL=ggml-tiny.bin  # Fast processing
```

### API Override (per request)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/job \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"youtube-url", "model":"ggml-base"}'
```

## Memory Requirements

### System Recommendations
- **Tiny Model**: 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
- **Base Model**: 4GB RAM minimum, 6GB recommended  
- **Small Model**: 6GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Medium Model**: 8GB RAM minimum, 12GB recommended
- **Large Model**: 12GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended

### Docker Memory Limits
```yaml
# Tiny model (current production)
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 800M
    reservations:
      memory: 400M

# Base model (if upgrading)
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 1200M
    reservations:
      memory: 600M
```

## Model Files Location

Models are stored in: `/whisper-models/`

```bash
# Check available models
ls -la /path/to/whisper-models/
-rw-r--r-- ggml-tiny.bin     (77MB)
-rw-r--r-- ggml-base.bin     (147MB) 
-rw-r--r-- ggml-small-q5_1.bin (190MB)
```

## Downloading Additional Models

### Download base model
```bash
cd /path/to/whisper-models/
curl -L -o ggml-base.bin \
  https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.bin
```

### Download medium model  
```bash
curl -L -o ggml-medium.bin \
  https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.bin
```

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found Error
```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "reason": "Not Found", 
  "detail": "model-name"
}
```
**Solution**: Check model file exists and filename matches exactly.

### Out of Memory Errors
```
Killed
Container whisper exited with code 137
```
**Solution**: Reduce Docker memory limits or use smaller model.

### Slow Processing
- Use `tiny` model for speed
- Check system has enough RAM
- Verify no other heavy processes running

## Recommendations

### For Most Users
- **Use `tiny` model** - Excellent balance of speed and quality
- Processing time: ~2-5 minutes for typical YouTube videos
- Quality: Good enough for most transcription needs

### For High-Quality Transcripts
- **Use `base` model** - Better accuracy with reasonable speed
- Processing time: ~5-15 minutes for typical videos
- Quality: Noticeably better for technical content, accents

### For Production Services
- **Start with `tiny`** - Fast user experience
- **Offer `base` as option** - For users who need higher quality
- **Monitor memory usage** - Scale resources as needed

## Current Status

✅ **Production Ready**: tiny model configured with optimized timeouts and retry logic
✅ **Fast Processing**: 5-10x faster than previous small model  
✅ **Memory Efficient**: Reduced memory requirements
✅ **Reliable**: Timeout issues resolved with shorter retry cycles
